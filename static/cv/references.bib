  abstract     = { The complexity of matrix multiplication is measured in terms of ω, the smallest real number such that two n × n matrices can be multiplied using O(nω+∊) field operations for all ∊ > 0; the best bound until now is ω < 2.37287 [Le Gall'14]. All bounds on ω since 1986 have been obtained using the so-called laser method, a way to lower-bound the ‘value’ of a tensor in designing matrix multiplication algorithms. The main result of this paper is a refinement of the laser method that improves the resulting value bound for most sufficiently large tensors. Thus, even before computing any specific values, it is clear that we achieve an improved bound on ω, and we indeed obtain the best bound on ω to date: ω < 2.37286. The improvement is of the same magnitude as the improvement that [Le Gall'14] obtained over the previous bound [Vassilevska W.'12]. Our improvement to the laser method is quite general, and we believe it will have further applications in arithmetic complexity. }

We present MASAGA, an extension of the stochastic average gradient variant SAGA on Riemannian manifolds. SAGA is a variance-reduction technique that typically outperforms methods that rely on expensive full-gradient calculations, such as the stochastic variance-reduced gradient method. We show that MASAGA achieves a linear convergence rate with uniform sampling, and we further show that MASAGA achieves a faster convergence rate with non-uniform sampling. Our experiments show that MASAGA is faster than the recent Riemannian stochastic gradient descent algorithm for the classic problem of finding the leading eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue.

The proposed approach uses new density-based divergences which, unlike existing methods of this type such as minimum Hellinger distance estimation, avoid the use of nonparametric density estimation and associated complications such as bandwidth selection. The proposed class of `density power divergences' is indexed by a single parameter α which controls the trade-off between robustness and efficiency. The methodology affords a robust extension of maximum likelihood estimation for which α = 0. Choices of α near zero afford considerable robustness while retaining efficiency close to that of maximum likelihood.},

  abstract = {Foreground detection is the first step in video surveillance system to detect moving objects. Recent research on subspace estimation by sparse representation and rank minimization represents a nice framework to separate moving objects from the background. Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) solved via Principal Component Pursuit decomposes a data matrix A in two components such that A=L+S, where L is a low-rank matrix and S is a sparse noise matrix. The background sequence is then modeled by a low-rank subspace that can gradually change over time, while the moving foreground objects constitute the correlated sparse outliers. To date, many efforts have been made to develop Principal Component Pursuit (PCP) methods with reduced computational cost that perform visually well in foreground detection. However, no current algorithm seems to emerge and to be able to simultaneously address all the key challenges that accompany real-world videos. This is due, in part, to the absence of a rigorous quantitative evaluation with synthetic and realistic large-scale dataset with accurate ground truth providing a balanced coverage of the range of challenges present in the real world. In this context, this work aims to initiate a rigorous and comprehensive review of RPCA-PCP based methods for testing and ranking existing algorithms for foreground detection. For this, we first review the recent developments in the field of RPCA solved via Principal Component Pursuit. Furthermore, we investigate how these methods are solved and if incremental algorithms and real-time implementations can be achieved for foreground detection. Finally, experimental results on the Background Models Challenge (BMC) dataset which contains different synthetic and real datasets show the comparative performance of these recent methods.}

  abstract = { To obtain the fault features of the bearing, a method based on variational mode decomposition (VMD), singular value decomposition (SVD) is proposed for fault diagnosis by Gath–Geva (G–G) fuzzy clustering. Firstly, the original signals are decomposed into mode components by VMD accurately and adaptively, and the spatial condition matrix (SCM) can be obtained. The SCM utilized as the reconstruction matrix of SVD can inherit the time delay parameter and embedded dimension automatically, and then the first three singular values from the SCM are used as fault eigenvalues to decrease the feature dimension and improve the computational efficiency. G–G clustering, one of the unsupervised machine learning fuzzy clustering techniques, is employed to obtain the clustering centers and membership matrices under various bearing faults. Finally, Hamming approach degree between the test samples and the known cluster centers is calculated to realize the bearing fault identification. By comparing with EEMD and EMD based on a recursive decomposition algorithm, VMD adopts a novel completely nonrecursive method to avoid mode mixing and end effects. Furthermore, the IMF components calculated from VMD include large amounts of fault information. G–G clustering is not limited by the shapes, sizes and densities in comparison with other clustering methods. VMD and G–G clustering are more suitable for fault diagnosis of the bearing system, and the results of experiment and engineering analysis show that the proposed method can diagnose bearing faults accurately and effectively. }

By adjusting these tuning parameters, we show that a wide range of standard and new divergences can be obtained. The corresponding learning algorithms for NMF are shown to integrate and generalize many existing ones, including the Lee-Seung, ISRA (Image Space Reconstruction Algorithm), EMML (Expectation Maximization Maximum Likelihood), Alpha-NMF, and Beta-NMF. Owing to more degrees of freedom in tuning the parameters, the proposed family of AB-multiplicative NMF algorithms is shown to improve robustness with respect to noise and outliers. The analysis illuminates the links of between AB-divergence and other divergences, especially Gamma- and Itakura-Saito divergences.},

In literature usually only one single asymmetric (Alpha, Beta or Gamma) divergence is considered. We show in this paper that there exist families of such divergences with the same consistent properties. Moreover, we establish links and correspondences among these divergences by applying suitable nonlinear transformations. For example, we can generate the Beta-divergences directly from Alpha-divergences and vice versa. Furthermore, we show that a new wide class of Gamma-divergences can be generated not only from the family of Beta-divergences but also from a family of Alpha-divergences. The paper bridges these divergences and shows also their links to Tsallis and Rényi entropies. Most of these divergences have a natural information theoretic interpretation.},

  abstract   = {Sharing or transmitting the digital information in online is increasing day by day since the usage of internet has become a habituation for everyone, which led to the large-scale violation of copyright issues. Now a days, majority of the data is being shared in the form of digital images which is quite easy for the copyright violators to forge and fake those images and then shared for profit. To deal with these copyright violations, digital watermarking came into existence as a potential solution that utilizes the concept of data hiding. This article proposed an approach for a non-blind color image watermarking (NB-CIW) by employing the algorithm named as singular value decomposition in translation invariant wavelet (SVD-TIW) domain. In addition, to further optimize the proposed SVD-TIW algorithm, enhanced grey-wolf optimizer (E-GWO) is presented which is an efficacious optimization approach in meta-heuristic algorithms. Further, to disclose the robustness and effectiveness of proposed NB-CIW using SVD-TIW-EGWO approach, different sort of attacks is enforced on watermarked image and extracted the accurate watermark image. Simulations on various test images with comparison to the state-of-art NB-CIW methodologies demonstrate the superiority of proposed NB-CIW using SVD-TIW-EGWO approach with respect to quality evaluation metrics like normalized cross correlation (NCC), root mean square error (RMSE), structural similarity (SSIM) index and even that of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) as well.},

The estimators are formed either from separate bivariate analyses or by simultaneous manipulation of all variables by using techniques such as multivariate trimming and M-estimation. The M-estimators stand up exceptionally well. They and the multivariate trimming procedure are especially effective at estimating the principal components, including a near singularity. However, the M-estimators can break down relatively easily when the dimensionality is large and the outliers are asymmetric. With missing data, the element-wise approach becomes more attractive.},

Background subtraction is then applied in order to separate the background and the foreground. In literature, background subtraction is surely among the most investigated field in computer vision providing a big amount of publications. Most of them concern the application of mathematical and machine learning models to be more robust to the challenges met in videos. However, the ultimate goal is that the background subtraction methods developed in research could be employed in real applications like traffic surveillance. But looking at the literature, we can remark that there is often a gap between the current methods used in real applications and the current methods in fundamental research. In addition, the videos evaluated in large-scale datasets are not exhaustive in the way that they only covered a part of the complete spectrum of the challenges met in real applications. In this context, we attempt to provide the most exhaustive survey as possible on real applications that used background subtraction in order to identify the real challenges met in practice, the current used background models and to provide future directions. Thus, challenges are investigated in terms of camera (i.e CCD cameras, omnidirectional cameras, …), foreground objects and environments. In addition, we identify the background models that are effectively used in these applications in order to find potential usable recent background models in terms of robustness, time and memory requirements.}

  abstract = {In statistical analyses the complexity of a chosen model is often related to the size of available data. One important question is whether the asymptotic distribution of the parameter estimates normally derived by taking the sample size to infinity for a fixed number of parameters would remain valid if the number of parameters in the model actually increases with the sample size. A number of authors have addressed this question for the linear models. The component-wise asymptotic normality of the parameter estimate remains valid if the dimension of the parameter space grows more slowly than some root of the sample size. In this paper, we consider M-estimators of general parametric models. Our results apply to not only linear regression but also other estimation problems such as multivariate location and generalized linear models. Examples are given to illustrate the applications in different settings.}

  abstract  = {We introduce a new method for robust principal component analysis (PCA). Classical PCA is based on the empirical covariance matrix of the data and hence is highly sensitive to outlying observations. Two robust approaches have been developed to date. The first approach is based on the eigenvectors of a robust scatter matrix such as the minimum covariance determinant or an S-estimator and is limited to relatively low-dimensional data. The second approach is based on projection pursuit and can handle high-dimensional data. Here we propose the ROBPCA approach, which combines projection pursuit ideas with robust scatter matrix estimation. ROBPCA yields more accurate estimates at noncontaminated datasets and more robust estimates at contaminated data. ROBPCA can be computed rapidly, and is able to detect exact-fit situations. As a by-product, ROBPCA produces a diagnostic plot that displays and classifies the outliers. We apply the algorithm to several datasets from chemometrics and engineering.},

We explore a class of quantile smoothing splines, defined as solutions to minσ Pc(yi\_g\\{(xi)\\}+λ (int10lgn(x)/pdx)1/p with pt(u)=u\\{t\_I(u\\&lt; )\\}, pages; 1, and appropriately chosen G. For the particular choices p = 1 and p = ∞ we characterise solutions g^ as splines, and discuss computation by standard l1-type linear programming techniques. At λ =0, g^ interpolates the τ th quantiles at the distinct design points, and for λ sufficiently large g^ is the linear regression quantile fit (Koenker \\&amp; Bassett, 1978) to the observations. Because the methods estimate conditional quantile functions they possess an inherent robustness to extreme observations in the yi's. The entire path of solutions, in the quantile parameter τ, or the penalty parameter λ2, may be efficiently computed by parametric linear programming methods. We note that the approach may be easily adapted to impose monotonicity and/or convexity constraints on the fitted function. An example is provided to illustrate the use of the proposed methods.}},

  abstract  = { In microarray data there are a number of biological samples, each assessed for the level of gene expression for a typically large number of genes. There is a need to examine these data with statistical techniques to help discern possible patterns in the data. Our technique applies a combination of mathematical and statistical methods to progressively take the data set apart so that different aspects can be examined for both general patterns and very specific effects. Unfortunately, these data tables are often corrupted with extreme values (outliers), missing values, and non-normal distributions that preclude standard analysis. We develop a robust analysis method to address these problems. The benefits of this robust analysis will be both the understanding of large-scale shifts in gene effects and the isolation of particular sample-by-gene effects that might be either unusual interactions or the result of experimental flaws. Our method requires a single pass and does not resort to complex ”cleaning” or imputation of the data table before analysis. We illustrate the method with a commercial data set. }

In the generic case, the classical total least-squares problem has a unique solution, which is given in analytic form in terms of the singular value decomposition of the data matrix. The weighted and structured total least-squares problems have no such analytic solution and are currently solved numerically by local optimization methods. We explain how special structure of the weight matrix and the data matrix can be exploited for efficient cost function and first derivative computation. This allows to obtain computationally efficient solution methods. The total least-squares family of methods has a wide range of applications in system theory, signal processing, and computer algebra. We describe the applications for deconvolution, linear prediction, and errors-in-variables system identification.}

  abstract  = {This article presents a form of bi-cross-validation (BCV) for choosing the rank in outer product models, especially the singular value decomposition (SVD) and the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). Instead of leaving out a set of rows of the data matrix, we leave out a set of rows and a set of columns, and then predict the left out entries by low rank operations on the retained data. We prove a self-consistency result expressing the prediction error as a residual from a low rank approximation. Random matrix theory and some empirical results suggest that smaller hold-out sets lead to more over-fitting, while larger ones are more prone to under-fitting. In simulated examples we find that a method leaving out half the rows and half the columns performs well.},

To this end, a hybrid algorithm for voice signal cryptography is presented in the three domain parser transforms, discrete cosine transform, and discrete wavelet transforms. So, after discrete cosine transformation (DCT) on the host signal, by selecting the sub-band of low frequency, which contains the highest signal energy, two discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with a random wavelet filter on the low-frequency coefficients of conversion A discrete cosine applies, after selecting the approximation coefficients, the resulting one-dimensional matrix is converted to a two-dimensional matrix, and finally the resulting matrix is applied to a single value decomposition (SVD), which results in the formation of a The diameter matrix is that the watermark bits are embedded in the first layer of the dipole matrix, so that the two bits with value S (1,1), S (2,2) of the matrix The diameter S is chosen, first compares the first and second intersections of the diameter matrix S, which is multiplied by the coefficient $\theta$ multiplied by the obtained two bits and is used as a fixed value in the embedding formula and The title of the new watermark is embedded in S (1,1). The results of the implementation show that the proposed algorithm succeeded not only in achieving transparency and resistance to general audio processing attacks, such as Gaussian white noise, quantization rates, decreasing and increasing the rate of sampling, compression and low pass filtering.

  abstract = {Surveillance cameras are vital source of information in crime investigations. A surveillance video must be recorded with correct field of view and be of good quality, otherwise, it may not be suitable for investigation or analysis purposes. Perpetrators may tamper the recorded video or the physical device itself, in order to conceal their dubious activities. Generally, surveillance systems are unmanned due to limitations of manual monitoring. Automatic detection of camera tamper events is crucial for timely operator intervention. We propose a new method for detecting video camera tampering events like occlusion, defocus and displacement. The features used are edge information, frame count, foreground objects' coverage area and its static nature. Effectiveness of our method is tested through experimentation on public datasets. The results obtained are encouraging with high detection and low false alarm rates. The proposed method automatically detects routine problems with cameras like dirt on camera lens, fog and smoke.},

  abstract       = {The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a fundamental algorithm used to understand the structure of data by providing insight into the relationship between the row and column factors. SVD aims to approximate a rectangular data matrix, given some rank restriction, especially lower rank approximation. In practical data analysis, however, outliers and missing values maybe exist that restrict the performance of SVD, because SVD is a least squares method that is sensitive to errors in the data matrix. This paper proposes a robust SVD algorithm by applying an adjustable robust estimator. Through adjusting the tuning parameter in the algorithm, the method can be both robust and efficient. Moreover, a sequential robust SVD algorithm is proposed in order to decrease the computation volume in sequential and streaming data. The advantages of the proposed algorithms are proved with a financial application.},

  abstract  = {We consider the problem of Robust PCA in the fully and partially observed settings. Without corruptions, this is the well-known matrix completion problem. From a statistical standpoint this problem has been recently well-studied, and conditions on when recovery is possible (how many observations do we need, how many corruptions can we tolerate) via polynomial-time algorithms is by now understood. This paper presents and analyzes a non-convex optimization approach that greatly reduces the computational complexity of the above problems, compared to the best available algorithms. In particular, in the fully observed case, with r denoting rank and d dimension, we reduce the complexity from O(r2d2 log(1/ε)) to O(rd2 log(1/ε)) - a big savings when the rank is big. For the partially observed case, we show the complexity of our algorithm is no more than O(r4d log d log(1/ε)). Not only is this the best-known run-time for a provable algorithm under partial observation, but in the setting where r is small compared to d, it also allows for near-linear-in-d run-time that can be exploited in the fully-observed case as well, by simply running our algorithm on a subset of the observations.},

This study compares the combination of singular value decomposition (SVD) and semi discrete decomposition (SDD), with that of hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), to examine patterns within a multielement soil geochemical dataset from an agricultural area in the vicinity of Pb--Zn mining operations in central Iran. SVD was used to both identify patterns of correlation between variables and samples and to ``denoise'' the data, and SDD to simultaneously cluster the samples and variables. The results reveal various spatial associations of mining waste-associated metals As, Ba, Pb and Zn, and within the remaining elements whose distribution is largely controlled by the major oxides. SVD--SDD was found to be superior to HCA, in its ability to detect subtle clusters in soil geochemistry indicative of mine-related contamination in the study area.},

However, it is shown that the singular values mainly reflect the energy of decomposed SCs, therefore traditional SVD denoising approaches are essentially energy-based, which tend to highlight the high-energy regular components in the measured signal, while ignoring the weak feature caused by early fault. To overcome this issue, a reweighted singular value decomposition (RSVD) strategy is proposed for signal denoising and weak feature enhancement. In this work, a novel information index called periodic modulation intensity is introduced to quantify the diagnostic information in a mechanical signal. With this index, the decomposed SCs can be evaluated and sorted according to their information levels, rather than energy. Based on that, a truncated linear weighting function is proposed to control the contribution of each SC in the reconstruction of the denoised signal. In this way, some weak but informative SCs could be highlighted effectively. The advantages of RSVD over traditional approaches are demonstrated by both simulated signals and real vibration/acoustic data from a two-stage gearbox as well as train bearings. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully extract the weak fault feature even in the presence of heavy noise and ambient interferences.}

  abstract  = {Low-rank and sparse structures have been profoundly studied in matrix completion and compressed sensing. In this paper, we develop "Go Decomposition" (GoDec) to efficiently and robustly estimate the low-rank part L and the sparse part S of a matrix X = L + S + G with noise G. GoDec alternatively assigns the low-rank approximation of X - S to L and the sparse approximation of X - L to S. The algorithm can be significantly accelerated by bilateral random projections (BRP). We also propose GoDec for matrix completion as an important variant. We prove that the objective value ||X - L - S||2F converges to a local minimum, while L and S linearly converge to local optimums. Theoretically, we analyze the influence of L, S and G to the asymptotic/convergence speeds in order to discover the robustness of GoDec. Empirical studies suggest the efficiency, robustness and effectiveness of GoDec comparing with representative matrix decomposition and completion tools, e.g., Robust PCA and OptSpace.},
