## Education

**Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata** | India<br/>
PhD in Statistics | Aug 2021 - June 2025<br/>
During my PhD, I was fortunate to work with [Ayanendranath Basu](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=HiIWY7sAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Abhik Ghosh](https://www.isical.ac.in/~abhik.ghosh/). My doctoral thesis is about developing fast and scalable algorithms for robust SVD and robust PCA using the minimum density power divergence.

- If you are interested in applying these methods, see this [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rsvddpd/index.html) or this [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/decompy/).

- If you are more into maths, may be take a look at my PhD thesis [here](https://dspace.isical.ac.in/jspui/handle/10263/7574).

## Places I have been

Most of my travel revolves around visiting academic conferences. So far, I have been to 4 out of 7 continents, and I hope to get to all 7 someday! 🗺️⁀જ✈︎

## Hobbies

### Pre-Stable Diffusion Era

One of my hobby was to build various 3D art forms using softwares like Bryce 3D, Daz Studio, Blender, etc. It was really fascinating to me to see how mathematical ideas (e.g. coordinate geometries) are applied in the 3D modelling world. Here's a [beginner friendly tutorial](https://www.cs.trinity.edu/~jhowland/class.files.cs357.html/blender/blender-stuff/m3d.pdf) on this topic.

Here are some outputs that came out of these activities.


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

img_path <- "./static/hobby_images/3darts"

files <- list.files(img_path, full.names = TRUE)

cat("::: {.grid}\n")

for (f in files) {
  cat("::: {.g-col-6 .g-col-md-4 .g-col-lg-3}\n")
  cat(sprintf("![](%s){.lightbox group=\"3darts\"}\n", f))
  cat(":::\n")
}

cat(":::\n")
```
