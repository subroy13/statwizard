    summary: In real life, we frequently come across data sets that involve some independent explanatory variable(s) generating a set of ordinal responses. In this paper, we explore a minimum distance estimation procedure based on the popular density power divergence (DPD) to yield robust parameter estimates for the ordinal response model.

    summary: Classical singular value decomposition suffers from presence of outliers in the data. In this article, we present the estimation of singular values through density power divergence which is robust and efficient.

    summary: This article examines Tea Auctions in India and forms an idea about the valuations that occur for several of the tea grades, and endeavoured to fit the model determining the final transaction price of the auction based on several relevant factors. The article also looks into the significance of manual valuations as predictors for the final price, and discussed several aspects to do away with the practice of manual valuations.
