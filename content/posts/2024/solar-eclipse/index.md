## Introduction

On April 8, 2024, the people in Texas, United States of America, will watch a cosmic event taking place before their very rise, a total solar eclipse. Well, if you're not a believer in the myths of asuras named Rahu and Ketu, then for you a solar eclipse occurs when the shadow of the moon falls directly on a location on the Earth, and the moon obstructs our view of the Sun. Since the sun's rotation, the moon's rotation, and the Earth's rotation details are all known to astronomers, it is kind of a deterministic mathematical problem to figure out when they are going to line up together. In this problem, we are going to dive deep into this mathematics, and try to figure out when these eclipses occur, and try to predict the future date of eclipses. 


## Some Background on Solar Eclipse

Before we submerge ourselves into the mathematical jargon, here's a brief background on solar eclipses. There are 3 kinds of solar eclipses: 

- Total
- Annular
- Partial

Here's a picture of three different types of eclipses from NASA.

To have an eclipse, the sun and the moon both have to align with the Earth. However, most of the time, this alignment happens with some approximation error, so we get partial eclipses for most of the time. In case the alignment happens, we get either the total eclipse or the annular eclipse. Among these two, total solar eclipse is rarer. This is because even if the Sun is so far away from us, its significant size makes it extremely difficult for the small moon to entirely cover it. This usually happens when the Earth is the most distant from the Sun in its orbit and the Moon is in the perigee, the nearest to the Earth in its orbit. 

This perfect alignment is indeed very rare, and even rarer is to be able to see this from the same location on the Earth. For instance, the last total solar eclipse that India has seen was on July 22, 2009 (about 15 years ago) and the next total solar eclipse in India will be seen on March 20, 2034 (about 10 years from now). 

It is astonishing to me that such rare events happening 10 years into the future can be predicted precisely to the exact date and time. In fact, NASA's computers can calculate these total solar eclipses using thousands of cosmological variables for about 100 years into the future, down to the precise second. In this post, we are going to touch upon the basis of these complex calculations slightly, to get a taste of it. NASA's math challenges[^1] are a great way to have some hands-on exercises about this, after you complete this post.
