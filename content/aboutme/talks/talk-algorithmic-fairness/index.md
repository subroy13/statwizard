# Abstract

This is a talk that I presented during the final year of my M.Stat. at Indian Statistical Institute, for the PCM Memorial Gold Medal Presentation.

During recent years, the extensive growth of statistics, artificial intelligence and machine learning systems in industrial applications enabled us to take data-driven automated decisions. However, many researchers have pointed out the ethical, moral, social implications of these algorithms as they learn to understand and mimic the historical data that is full of injustice, unfairness and prejudices. In this talk, we shall dive into some motivating examples ranging from gender discrimination in hiring, racial discrimination in recidivism prediction in judicial systems to understand the pressing requirement of algorithmic fairness. I would also discuss about different fairness criteria such as independence, sufficiency and separation, and, how they all can be incorporated into any black-box decision system. Finally, I would end with a note on why these criteria are usually difficult to satisfy in practice and some possible solutions that are being researched.
