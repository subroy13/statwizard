# Abstract

This article examines Tea Auctions in India and forms an idea about the valuations that occur for several of the tea grades,
and endeavoured to fit the model determining the final transaction price of the auction based on several relevant factors.
The article also looks into the significance of manual valuations as predictors for the final price, and discussed several
aspects to do away with the practice of manual valuations. 

Tea (Camellia sinensis) is consumed across the world but its production is geographically limited to a few areas with China, India and Sri Lanka being the major producers. The tea industry is one of the oldest organized industries in India which derives its importance by being one of the major foreign exchange earners and for playing a vital role towards employment generation as the industry is highly labour intensive.

Tea is heterogeneous both over season and region, and even intra region and its demand is very price sensitive. Price elasticities for black tea vary between -0.32 and -0.80, which means that a 10% increase in black tea retail prices
will lead to a decline in demand for black tea between 3.2% and 8%, according to Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO). 

Due to the variation of quality, tea within same grades are sold at a very wide range of prices in an auction. For
example, on any given auction day, say Broken Pekoe (BP) variety would sell at a range starting from as low as Rs 60 to Rs 250 per kg. This is another reason making standardization difficult.

From picking up tea leaves to reach at our cup as a refreshing drink, an inherent process connecting these steps is an auction mechanism. Manufactured tea leaves is dispatched from various gardens/ estates to the auction centres for sale through the appointed auctioneers, who upon tasting samples from the tea packets, gives a subjective valuation of the tea, which is supposed to be an educated guess about the price of the tea packet. Based on this valuation, a base price is set for the online auction, and is sold to the highest bidding buyer, who in turn is a retailer of the tea in the publicly reachable market.

Given the above complexities, the aim in this study is to evaluate the feasibility of automating this pricing process to the extent of dispensing with the manual testing and valuation steps.
