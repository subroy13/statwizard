# Abstract 

This article analyses various patterns in the pollution levels of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 at various locations in Kolkata, India. Our analysis is based on a data set recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board of India and the West Bengal Pollution Control Board, comprising of about 15 years of irregular time series observations, due to the higher cost of precise and accurate measurements of pollution. We perform some exploratory analysis concerning the variations in trend, seasonal, and shift-specific seasonal levels. As well as a statistical model for forecasting pollution levels for two to three days in advance is also obtained, along with an analysis of the effects of festivities such as Kali Puja and Diwali on the level of the pollutants across different locations.
