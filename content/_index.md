story: "I believe in the magic of statistics and its profound impact on understanding the world around us. While learning statistics, data science and other related concepts from both academic and industrial world, I felt mesmerized and become passionate about these. I strongly believed that the concepts behind the newer technologies coming out everyday should be open-source, accessible to all irrespective of their diverse backgrounds. It should not hide behind any paywalls or esoteric academic jargons. So I decided to share whatever interesting stuffs that I learn on my website, all for free. And this gave birth to StatWizard."
