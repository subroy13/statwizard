story: "I believe in the magic of statistics and its profound impact on understanding the world around us. While learning statistics, data science and other related concepts from both academic and industrial world, I felt mesmerized and become passionate about these. I also strongly believed in the open-source framework and hence started thinking about sharing the wizardry and making complex concepts accessible to all. So, StatWizard was born."
