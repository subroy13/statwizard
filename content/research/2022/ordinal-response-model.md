summary: In real life, we frequently come across data sets that involve some independent explanatory variable(s) generating a set of ordinal responses. In this paper, we explore a minimum distance estimation procedure based on the popular density power divergence (DPD) to yield robust parameter estimates for the ordinal response model.
