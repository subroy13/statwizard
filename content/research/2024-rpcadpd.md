summary: Usual Principal component analysis (PCA) is wildly impacted by the presence of outliers. In this article, we present a technique to obtain robust principal component estimates using minimum density power divergence estimators. Theoretical guarantees of convergence, consistency, asymptotic distribution and robustness are derived.
