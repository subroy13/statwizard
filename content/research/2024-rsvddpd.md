summary: Classical singular value decomposition suffers from presence of outliers in the data. In this article, we present a novel algorithm called rSVDdpd that enables robust estimation of singular values and vectors through minimum density power divergence estimator. The algorithm is scalable, highly parallelizable and computationally efficient. In addition to the theoretical findings, we demonstrate an application of background modelling for video surveillance data.
