      <title>The Information Content of Taster&#39;s Valuation in Tea Auctions of India</title>
      <link>/aboutme/publications/information-content-tea-arxiv/</link>

      <description>Tea auctions across India occur as an ascending open auction, conducted online. Before the auction, a sample of the tea lot is sent to potential bidders and a group of tea tasters. The seller&amp;rsquo;s reserve price is a confidential function of the tea taster&amp;rsquo;s valuation, which also possibly acts as a signal to the bidders.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Transparent Price Discovery in Tea through Auction in India</title>
      <link>/aboutme/publications/tea-auction-feasibility/</link>

      <description>This article examines Tea Auctions in India and forms an idea about the valuations that occur for several of the tea grades, and endeavoured to fit the model determining the final transaction price of the auction based on several relevant factors. The article also looks into the significance of manual valuations as predictors for the final price, and discussed several aspects to do away with the practice of manual valuations.</description>
