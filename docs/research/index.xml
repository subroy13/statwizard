      <title>Robust Principal Component Analysis using Density Power Divergence</title>

      <description>Usual Principal component analysis (PCA) is wildly impacted by the presence of outliers. In this article, we present a technique to obtain robust principal component estimates using minimum density power divergence estimators. Theoretical guarantees of convergence, consistency, asymptotic distribution and robustness are derived.</description>

      <title>Robust singular value decomposition with application to video surveillance background modelling</title>

      <description>Classical singular value decomposition suffers from presence of outliers in the data. In this article, we present a novel algorithm called rSVDdpd that enables robust estimation of singular values and vectors through minimum density power divergence estimator. The algorithm is scalable, highly parallelizable and computationally efficient. In addition to the theoretical findings, we demonstrate an application of background modelling for video surveillance data.</description>

      <title>Robust and Efficient Estimation in Ordinal Response Models using the Density Power Divergence</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/research/2024-ordinal-response-model/</link>

      <description>In real life, we frequently come across data sets that involve some independent explanatory variable(s) generating a set of ordinal responses. In this paper, we explore a minimum distance estimation procedure based on the popular density power divergence (DPD) to yield robust parameter estimates for the ordinal response model.</description>

      <description>This article examines Tea Auctions in India and forms an idea about the valuations that occur for several of the tea grades, and endeavoured to fit the model determining the final transaction price of the auction based on several relevant factors. The article also looks into the significance of manual valuations as predictors for the final price, and discussed several aspects to do away with the practice of manual valuations.</description>
