      <description>This is the 5th part of the Reinforcement Learning Series: Here I discuss about techniques to finding optimal policies, and then demonstrate the popular Q-learning algorithm. I also show how it can be implemented to solve actual problems</description>

      <description>This is the 4th part of the Reinforcement Learning Series: Here I discuss about how the idea of Bellman equations and Monte Carlo methods can be combined into a single algorithm called Temporal Difference. We will also learn about its variants and how we can use it to estimate the value functions.</description>

      <description>This is the third part of the Reinforcement Learning series: Here I discuss about the representing the reinforcement learning problem as a markov decision process, explain standard terminologies and provide ways to estimate the value function.</description>
