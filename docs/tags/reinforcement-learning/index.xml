      <description>This is the 4th part of the Reinforcement Learning Series: Here I discuss about how the idea of Bellman equations and Monte Carlo methods can be combined into a single algorithm called Temporal Difference. We will also learn about its variants and how we can use it to estimate the value functions.</description>
