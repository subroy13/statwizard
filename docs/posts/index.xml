      <description>Introduction A few days ago, I saw this video by Derek Muller on his channel Veritasium1 and came to know about the discovery of blue LED by Shuji Nakamura2. It was a nice video, (I highly recommend watching it) and I was thinking of how significant that discovery was.
To begin with, it led to the creation of smart LED screen that you see on mobile phones, smart TVs, tablets or any other current-era electronic devices.</description>

      <description>This is the 4th part of the Reinforcement Learning Series: Here I discuss about how the idea of Bellman equations and Monte Carlo methods can be combined into a single algorithm called Temporal Difference. We will also learn about its variants and how we can use it to estimate the value functions.</description>

      <guid>/posts/2020/covid19-esir-model/</guid>
      <description>In this post, we describe a slight generalization of the basic SIR model of epidemiology and its estimation procedure under both frequentist and Bayesian paradigms. We also make projections of the covid cases over next several days based on the fitted model.</description>
