      <description>This is the 4th part of the Reinforcement Learning Series: Here I discuss about how the idea of Bellman equations and Monte Carlo methods can be combined into a single algorithm called Temporal Difference. We will also learn about its variants and how we can use it to estimate the value functions.</description>

      <description>This is the third part of the Reinforcement Learning series: Here I discuss about the representing the reinforcement learning problem as a markov decision process, explain standard terminologies and provide ways to estimate the value function.</description>

      <description>This is the first introductory post on Random Matrix Theory series: Here I demonstrate some phenemenon about random matrices which are very non-intuitive to the classical thinking of asymptotic result</description>

      <description>In this post, I analyse Texture Network, a special type of neural network to synthesize textures and performing Neural Style Transfer, the art of mixing the content of a picture with the style from another picture.</description>

      <title>Analysis of basic Epidemiological models - Part 2</title>

      <description>In this post, we describe a slight generalization of the basic SIR model of epidemiology and its estimation procedure under both frequentist and Bayesian paradigms. We also make projections of the covid cases over next several days based on the fitted model.</description>
