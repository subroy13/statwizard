      <description>On April 8, 2024, the people in Texas, United States of America, will watch a cosmic event taking place before their very eyes, a total solar eclipse. But how can this be predicted so accurately down to the second in advance, when our weather predictions are often wrong? In this post, we are going to see how simple mathematics can help us predict these cosmic events so precisely.</description>

      <description>Introduction A few days ago, I saw this video by Derek Muller on his channel Veritasium1 and came to know about the discovery of blue LED by Shuji Nakamura2. It was a nice video, (I highly recommend watching it) and I was thinking of how significant that discovery was.&#xA;To begin with, it led to the creation of smart LED screen that you see on mobile phones, smart TVs, tablets or any other current-era electronic devices.</description>
